# Front Loops - Level up your html and css

> There will be 30 tasks split into 3 sections called "loops". Each 10th will be a challenge that will ask you to code a full website page. As you progress - task will become more and more complex.

> All design are provided as .jpg images. You will also get a video of how should page behave to user interactions. This course is mostly about using techniques of building interfaces, not about pixel perfect code.
